TODO:

Refactor code:
Make it easier to add new blocks by creating a JSON? maybe, that then filters through into the level editor HTML, the Hoppers object and the drawGameBoard function (and any others that need it)

Game ideas:
Moveable arrow blocks
Bad hopper

UI:
Generally improve UI, maybe use Vue

End game:
Make it so ppl can save and share levels, social aspects
